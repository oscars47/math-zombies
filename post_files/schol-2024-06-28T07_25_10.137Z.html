            <p class="caption">Chat GPT's interpretation of the "Guessing Game."</p>
            <pre>My last article centered on this notion of AI models surpassing our previous metrics for “intelligence.” Recently, Anthropic pushed this further with the release of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a>, which beat Chat GPT-4o in several benchmarks in language facility and knowledge. However, while personally as a physicist I very much admire and ground my scientific thinking in terms of metrics (and we don’t bring in the mathematicians here), sometimes they can be misleading. 

This past week, I was thinking about other ways of testing intelligence in AI, and in particular the notion that accuracy isn’t everything—what matters isn’t necessarily if, when asked a question, someone is right or wrong, but in how they answer. Of course, there are unanswerable or ill-posed questions, more abstract tasks that require creative thinking. 

This past week I was also in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, which are home to the largest trees by volume in the world. I was with my family and during hikes for fun, we played a game called 10 questions. It’s pretty simple: one person comes up with a noun, and the other people have 10 questions to guess your item; but the person who answers can only use “yes” or “no”, with the occasional qualifiers. 

I realized this was a great task for LLMs to tackle, since it would test memory and logical deduction. I asked both Chat GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 to play this game with me, and their complete responses are recorded below. This week, I selected the item (a water bottle); next week, I’ll reverse the roles.

-------------------------------------------------

User: Let's play a game. I have an item in my mind. You get 10 questions to ask. If you guess it correctly, you win. If not, I win. Let's begin.

Claude: Understood. I'll ask questions to try and guess the item you're thinking of. I'll keep track of the number of questions asked. Let's begin with the first question:

Is the item a physical object (as opposed to something abstract or conceptual)?

User: yes

Claude: Thank you. Let's continue with the next question:

Is this object typically found inside a home?

User: yes, but you can take it outside

Claude: I see. That narrows it down a bit. Let's proceed with the next question:

Is this object primarily used for a practical purpose (as opposed to decoration or entertainment)?

User: yes

Claude: Alright, we're making progress. Let's continue:

Is this object typically handheld or portable?

User: yes, handheld

Claude: That's helpful information. Moving on to the next question:

Is this object used for communication or information in any way (like a phone or book)?

User: or sorry, you can take back that question. it is portable, you can carry it around or set it down

Claude: I appreciate the clarification. I'll rephrase my previous question then:

Is this object primarily used for personal care or grooming?

User: no

Claude: Thank you for the information. Let's continue:

Is this object used for food or drink preparation or consumption?

User: yes

Claude: That's a valuable clue. Let's narrow it down further:

Is this object used for consuming beverages specifically?

User: yes

Claude: We're getting closer. Based on the information so far, I have a guess, but I'll ask two more questions to be sure:

Is this object typically made of glass, ceramic, or similar materials?

User: it can be

Claude: I see. This is helpful. For my ninth question:

Does this object usually have a handle?

User: no

Claude: Thank you for that information. For my final question:

Is this object a cup or mug?

User: not exactly but very similar

Claude: Based on all the information provided, and since you mentioned it's very similar to a cup or mug but not exactly, I believe the item you're thinking of is: A glass or tumbler. This fits all the criteria: it's a physical object typically found in homes but can be taken outside, it's practical, portable, used for consuming beverages, can be made of glass or similar materials, and doesn't usually have a handle. It's very similar to a cup or mug, but distinct enough that you said it wasn't exactly that. Have I guessed correctly, or did you have something else in mind?

User: i was thinking water bottle, but you're so close!

Claude: Ah, a water bottle! You're right, I was very close. Water bottles share many characteristics with glasses and tumblers, which is why my reasoning led me in that direction. A water bottle fits all the criteria we discussed:

- It's a physical object
- Found in homes but often taken outside
- Used for a practical purpose
- Portable and can be handheld
- Used for consuming beverages
- Can be made of various materials, including glass
- Typically doesn't have a handle
- Very similar to a cup or mug, but distinct

The main difference is that water bottles are usually designed for portability and to be sealed, which I didn't specifically ask about.

This was a great game! You chose an interesting item that was challenging to guess. Thank you for playing and for the enjoyable conversation. Would you like to play another round or discuss anything else?

-------------------------------------------------

In this experiment, there were several key differences between the models in their approaches and performances. While both AI models struggled to guess the correct item (a water bottle) within the initial 10 questions, their strategies and communication styles varied significantly. ChatGPT's approach seemed more scattered, getting sidetracked with questions about furniture and camping equipment before eventually honing in on outdoor activities. In contrast, Claude's questioning strategy appeared more focused, quickly narrowing down to beverage-related items. Now, I will note that perhaps I was a bit misleading at times: I said “yes” to “is it found indoors” to Chat GPT, but to Claude I said “yes, but you can take it outside.” Therefore on the basis of that difference I will not punish Chat GPT too severely nor praise Claude too much.

The most striking difference was in the models' final responses. Claude provided a detailed explanation of its reasoning, demonstrating a higher level of analytical and communicative ability. It also showed remarkable self-awareness by pointing out what it hadn't asked about (sealing and portability), which could have led to the correct answer. This level of reflection and insight suggests more advanced “cognitive” faculties. Additionally, Claude's responses included more conversational elements (e.g., That’s a valuable clue…, This is helpful”), making the interaction feel more natural and human-like.

While the experiment revealed potential areas of improvement for both models—such as the need for more efficient questioning and better handling of ambiguous information—to me talking to the models felt fundamentally different. Chat GPT felt less sharp and cognizant than Claude, and I was in fact surprised by Claude’s superior sense of awareness of not just what it knew but what it didn’t know. This ability is crucial in the development of better, more generalized AI and so marks an exciting step towards that goal. What do you think? Does Claude feel more human like and act as if engaging in thought? But is this thought? Is there a point at which an imitation actually becomes the thing it imitates?</pre>
