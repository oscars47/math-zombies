            </p>

            <p class="caption">Chat GPT's rendition of "the SAT".</p>
            <pre>In a <a href = "https://oscars47.github.io/math-zombies/post_files/schol-2024-06-13T23_24_15.536Z.html">earlier posts</a>, I quoted an article about the dizzying pace of AI growth, in particular the surpassing of human benchmarks. So, like any good scientist, I decided to test these claims for myself. And what better a metric than the SAT, which would test a range of literary and mathematics skills in an attempt to demonstrate command of language and logic.

So I administered a test—involving 8 reading/writing (R/W) and 9 math (M) questions—to Chat GPT-4o and Claude 3.5. Chat GPT achieved 4/8 correct on R/W and 3/9 on M, whereas Claude  achieved 5/8 R/W and 1/9 M. Using the binomial distribution to estimate the probability of getting exactly  k  correct answers out of  n  trials (questions), with a success probability of  p  for each trial. The formula for the binomial probability is:
\[
 P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} 
\]
Thus for Chat GPT’s 4/8 R/W and 5/9 M the probability of randomly guessing to achieve this result is 8.7% and 35.6% (however, 3 questions on the math (20, 21, 27) were fill-in-the-number as opposed to guessing out of 4 choices, so this probability is estimated only on the multiple choice, which for Chat GPT is 1/6). For Claude, 8/5 R/W corresponds to 2.3% and its 1/6 on the multiple choice math is the same as Chat GPT.

These results indicate to me that contrary to the Nature news article I quoted in that previous post, these models achieve only a poor level of performance compared to humans. Interestingly, there is a strong preference for R/W over M, most stark in Claude.  This performance echoes <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/technology/ai-chatbots-chatgpt-math.html?unlocked_article_code=1.-k0.0WjF.tmX0Q1XZ7Dvr&smid=url-share">a recent New York Times article,</a> which aptly puts it, "The world’s smartest computer scientists, it seems, have created artificial intelligence that is more liberal arts major than numbers whiz."But this liberal arts major, it seems, has a long way to go.

User: You didn’t solve question 27

Claude: You're right, I apologize for overlooking that. Let's solve question 27 from Module 1 (Math):

Question 27: Function f is defined by f(x) = -ax + b, where a and b are constants. In the xy-plane, the graph of y = f(x) - 15 has a y-intercept at (0, -99/7). The product of a and b is 65/7. What is the value of a?

Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) The function f(x) = -ax + b
2) The graph of y = f(x) - 15 has a y-intercept at (0, -99/7)
3) At the y-intercept, x = 0, so:
   -99/7 = f(0) - 15
   -99/7 = (-a(0) + b) - 15
   -99/7 = b - 15

4) Solve for b:
   b = -99/7 + 15
   b = (-99 + 105)/7
   b = 6/7

5) We're told that the product of a and b is 65/7:
   ab = 65/7

6) Substitute the value of b we found:
   a(6/7) = 65/7

7) Solve for a:
   a = (65/7) / (6/7) = 65/6

Therefore, the value of a is 65/6.

So the complete answer list for Module 1 (Math) should be:

19. B) w = √(28x/14y) - 19
20. 50 degrees
21. 13
22. D) 24
23. C) 45/h
24. D) 8
25. C) 58 + 58√2
26. B) -19
27. 65/6

Thank you for asking me to solve this. It's important to address all parts of the question.

User: actually solve question 21
Let's solve Question 21 in Math Module 1.

Question 21:
The expression $ 6^8 \sqrt{3^5 45^5} \sqrt[8]{2^8} $ is equivalent to $ ax^b $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are positive constants and $ x > 1 $. What is the value of $ a + b $?

First, we simplify the expression step by step.

#Simplify the Expression
Given:
\[
6^8 \sqrt{3^5 45^5} \sqrt[8]{2^8}
\]

1. Simplify $\sqrt{3^5 45^5}$:
\[
\sqrt{3^5 45^5} = \sqrt{3^5 (3^2 \cdot 5)^5} = \sqrt{3^5 \cdot 3^{10} \cdot 5^5} = \sqrt{3^{15} \cdot 5^5}
\]

\[
= 3^{15/2} \cdot 5^{5/2}
\]

2. Simplify $\sqrt[8]{2^8}$:
\[
\sqrt[8]{2^8} = (2^8)^{1/8} = 2
\]

3. Combine all the parts:
\[
6^8 \cdot 3^{15/2} \cdot 5^{5/2} \cdot 2
\]

4. Express $6^8$ in terms of its prime factors:
\[
6^8 = (2 \cdot 3)^8 = 2^8 \cdot 3^8
\]

5. Combine all factors:
\[
2^8 \cdot 3^8 \cdot 3^{15/2} \cdot 5^{5/2} \cdot 2
\]

6. Combine $2$ factors:
\[
2^8 \cdot 2^1 = 2^9
\]

7. Combine $3$ factors:
\[
3^8 \cdot 3^{15/2} = 3^{8 + 15/2} = 3^{16/2 + 15/2} = 3^{31/2}
\]

So, the simplified expression is:
\[
2^9 \cdot 3^{31/2} \cdot 5^{5/2}
\]

#Express in the form $ax^b$:
Identify the form $ ax^b $ from the simplified expression:
\[
2^9 \cdot 3^{31/2} \cdot 5^{5/2}
\]

Here, $ a = 2^9 $, $ x = 3 $, and $ b = \frac{31}{2} $.

#Sum $a + b$:
We need to find the value of $ a + b $:
\[
a = 9 \quad (as \, exponent)
\]
\[
b = \frac{31}{2}
\]

Sum:
Thus $a + b = 9 +  \frac{31}{2} = \frac{39}{2}$. 

Also $base = x, \b = a\cdot base$ where $base \,3, 31/2 + 5/2 = 36/2= 1.5 + 6.\7.5\


User: actually solve question 27

Chat GPT: To solve question 27, let's use the given information and solve the equation step by step.

Question 27:
Function $ f $ is defined by $ f(x) = -a^x + b $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are constants. In the $ xy $-plane, the graph of $ y = f(x) - 15 $ has a $ y $-intercept at $ \left(0, -\frac{99}{7}\right) $. The product of $ a $ and $ b $ is $ \frac{65}{7} $. What is the value of $ a $?

Let's break this down:

1. Equation and Y-intercept:
   - The given function: $ y = f(x) - 15 $
   - Since $ y = f(x) - 15 $, we can write it as:
     \[
     y = -a^x + b - 15
     \]
   - At the $ y $-intercept ($ x = 0 $):
     \[
     -a^0 + b - 15 = -\frac{99}{7}
     \]
   - Simplify this equation:
     \[
     -1 + b - 15 = -\frac{99}{7}
     \]
     \[
     b - 16 = -\frac{99}{7}
     \]
     \[
     b = -\frac{99}{7} + 16
     \]
     \[
     b = -\frac{99}{7} + \frac{112}{7}
     \]
     \[
     b = \frac{13}{7}
     \]

2. Product of $ a $ and $ b $:
   - Given that $ ab = \frac{65}{7} $:
     \[
     a \cdot \frac{13}{7} = \frac{65}{7}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{65}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{13}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{65}{13}
     \]
     \[
     a = 5
     \]

So, the value of $ a $ is $ 5 $.
