            <pre>The point of new knowledge is to say interesting things, right? We go through life and find meaning in the new information we get every day, either through our own experiences or by learning of it vicariously—whether it be through friends or family or the news or social media. Can generative AI create new knowledge? That is something I’ve struggled with since the debut of ChatGPT to the public, and I’m not really sure at the moment it can. Certainly, it knows more than any one person, but when we look at the realm of our pooled knowledge, is AI just dipping into it and hoping that the well never runs out? But this focus on interesting things to say led me to think about what qualifies as something interesting, after all, what may be interesting to one person doesn’t mean it holds interest for another. <a href="post_files/kmbc2-2024-07-19T21_08_08.861Z.html">Read More...</a>

            <pre>I am as usual late on some of my projects. One involves the drafting of an article, and I have been thinking about it for a long while now. I know this to be true for my writing process: I take forever to get started. But my first draft usually tends to come out really fast once I do get started. Anne Lamott calls those first quick drafts by <a href="https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf">a less family-friendly term</a> but at least in my case, she is right on about their usefulness. The point of these types of first drafts is supposed to be to simply get the first chunk of gunk out of your mind so that your creative juices get replenished and you start making novel connections and see new pathways through the mess that is the outcome of the research and thinking you have already done.  <a href="post_files/gizem-2024-07-17T06_00_23.355Z.html">Read More...</a>

            <h3>Efficiency: AI Implementation in Theory and in Practice</h3>
            <p class = "post-name">Kamden Baer</p>

            <p class="caption">Checks and Balances and Technology.</p>
            <pre>One of the open-ended questions in my last post was highlighted by Oscar, who—in response to “what happens when the goal is not to be more efficient?”—noted that the goal of AI generally <i> is </i> greater efficiency. I see no reason to disagree, and on my own I cannot come up with any sort of counterexample or exception. When I asked ChatGPT-4o to give examples of goals of artificial intelligence other than efficiency, it gave and explained the following list: enhancing human creativity, improving decision-making, personalization, accessibility, advancing scientific research, sustainability, healthcare improvements, safety and security, education advancement, and cultural preservation. In my broad understanding of the concept, I would consider many of these goals to still fall under the umbrella of efficiency, or at least causes of greater efficiency. That being said, I might have been giving AI too much credit when it comes to its capabilities. I overlooked the fact that ultimately (at least at the moment…) we as people decide how AI is created and implemented. My qualm with AI might have less to do with its aim of efficiency, and more to do with its implementation as a tool to beget efficiency.

            <pre>In this article, it’s round 2 for 20 questions! (In my <a href = "https://oscars47.github.io/math-zombies/post_files/schol-2024-06-28T07_25_10.137Z.html" >previous article</a> in this series, I played a game of 10 questions just to make it a little bit harder for the ML models, ha!) As before, it’s me against 2 ML models, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and ChatGPT-4o. However, in this attempt, the roles are reversed: now ChatGPT and Claude will guess an item and it is my task to determine what that item is in 20 questions or fewer. <a href="post_files/schol-2024-07-11T22_17_48.184Z.html">Read More...</a>

            <pre>A point I keep coming back to in my musings on AI, that I want to explore now and hopefully return to from different angles in the future, is this: what are our goals with ChatGPT? There are lots of different answers, and questions posed as answers that only lead to more questions, and I think they all might help clarify the current state of AI, as well as some of its past and future. I admire the big-picture thinkers that adhere to the idea that this chatbot is an artificial intelligence product—that we have constructed a concrete model of an intelligence different from that of human intelligence. I also respect the students and professionals simply trying to save time by doing a little less reading of their homework assignment or business report by using ChatGPT, but maybe in a slightly different way. These people have goals for their use of AI, motivations for these goals, and experiences that lead to these motivations. <a href="post_files/kmbc2-2024-07-08T15_32_37.028Z.html">Read More...</a>

However, now that I have years more mathematical experience under my belt, it’s always fun to think about these kinds of problems in a new light. I came across one particular problem from my mom who was tutoring a high schooler in a summer geometry class, which I found interesting. I wondered how Chat GPT-4o would solve it.

            <pre>My last article centered on this notion of AI models surpassing our previous metrics for “intelligence.” Recently, Anthropic pushed this further with the release of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a>, which beat Chat GPT-4o in several benchmarks in language facility and knowledge. However, while personally as a physicist I very much admire and ground my scientific thinking in terms of metrics (and we don’t bring in the mathematicians here), sometimes they can be misleading.  <a href="post_files/schol-2024-06-28T07_25_10.137Z.html">Read More...</a>
