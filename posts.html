            <pre>A point I keep coming back to in my musings on AI, that I want to explore now and hopefully return to from different angles in the future, is this: what are our goals with ChatGPT? There are lots of different answers, and questions posed as answers that only lead to more questions, and I think they all might help clarify the current state of AI, as well as some of its past and future. I admire the big-picture thinkers that adhere to the idea that this chatbot is an artificial intelligence product—that we have constructed a concrete model of an intelligence different from that of human intelligence. I also respect the students and professionals simply trying to save time by doing a little less reading of their homework assignment or business report by using ChatGPT, but maybe in a slightly different way. These people have goals for their use of AI, motivations for these goals, and experiences that lead to these motivations. <a href="post_files/kmbc2-2024-07-08T15_32_37.028Z.html">Read More...</a>

            <pre>Admittedly, it’s been a while since high school geometry. However, now that I have years more mathematical experience under my belt, it’s always fun to think about these kinds of problems in a new light. I came across one particular problem from my mom who was tutoring a high schooler in a summer geometry class, which I found interesting. I wondered how Chat GPT-4o would solve it. How would it approach it? <a href="post_files/schol-2024-07-04T10_05_30.277Z.html">Read More...</a>

            <pre>One of the points we made in our paper "Computo, Ergo Sum: Teaching and Learning Mathematics in the Age of ChatGPT" (available for now at https://gkaraali.sites.pomona.edu/research/ComputoErgoSum.pdf) was about how the possibility of an emergent intelligence surpassing our own could help us.

            <pre>My last article centered on this notion of AI models surpassing our previous metrics for “intelligence.” Recently, Anthropic pushed this further with the release of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a>, which beat Chat GPT-4o in several benchmarks in language facility and knowledge. However, while personally as a physicist I very much admire and ground my scientific thinking in terms of metrics (and we don’t bring in the mathematicians here), sometimes they can be misleading.  <a href="post_files/schol-2024-06-28T07_25_10.137Z.html">Read More...</a>

            <pre>French philosopher Bruno Latour (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Latour) starts his article "Love Your Monsters: Why We Must Care for Our Technologies as we do Our Children" with Mary Shelley and her most famous creation, the monster erroneously known as Frankenstein. Some of us, having read Shelley's Frankenstein, Or, the Modern Prometheus, might smirk knowingly when we hear that. Of course Frankenstein is not the monster's name; it is the name of its creator! <a href="post_files/gizem-2024-06-20T04_59_50.816Z.html">Read More...</a>

            <pre>“The rate of progress is pretty shocking to a lot of people, me included,” Rein adds. “It’s quite difficult to make a benchmark that survives for more than a few years.”  Like some say a Creator made Us in Their image, so we have made ChatGPT in ours; let us hope for our sake, as our models develop, they, unlike us, do not eat from the Tree of Knowledge. <a href="post_files/schol-2024-06-13T23_24_15.536Z.html">Read More...</a>
